# Travel_Log
This is a simple location-logging console application designed to quickly record the computer's location when prompted by the user. The purpose of this application is mainly recreational and will serve as the basis for a more complex program in the future.


Project Features include
#1
Main menu that allows users to log their location, look at previous locations, and exit the program.

Required Feature Addressed: Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.


#2
Automatic location logging when the user enters the corresponding command from the main menu (will use computer location services or pull location information from Google Maps). Location information will be displayed in street address or longitudinal/latitudinal form. 

Required Feature Addressed: Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app.


3
Retrieves previously logged location information and displays said information to the user when requested via the corresponding command from the main menu.

Required Feature Addressed: Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.




Possible Project Features
4
Logs runtime errors and invalid inputs and records them in a text file viewable by the user.

Required Feature Addressed: Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.


5
Tests program functionality via 3 unit tests, to aid in continued program functionality.

Required Feature Addressed: Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
