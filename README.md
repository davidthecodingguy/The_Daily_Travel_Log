# The_Daily_Travel_Log
This is a simple location-logging console application designed to record the user's location when input by the user, and display previously entered location information within the program. The purpose of this application is mainly recreational and serves as a project for continued improvement and learning. 
<br />
<br />
The error log file can be found by searching for DailyTravelLogErrors.txt within your computer's memory, if you wish to view it outside of the program. *Please note that occasionally the program will save errors to new versions/instances of the file. This does not affect previous error retrieval and it is not necessary to find this text file for program functionality.*
<br />
<br />
**Project Features:**
<br />
<br />
#1:
Improved program unit tests, to aid in continued program functionality. Unit tests will be saved to either a text file or a database.
<br />
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
<br />
<br />
#2:
Logs runtime errors and invalid inputs and records them in a database or file viewable by the user. Errors or exceptions will also be displayed to the user when encountered.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
<br />
<br />
#3:
Implements a list to separate concerns of retrieving and saving data and to allow easier implementation of the RetrievePreviousLocations class in multiple locations. This also aids in the formatting of previous location information for user legibility.
<br />
**Required Feature Addressed:** Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
